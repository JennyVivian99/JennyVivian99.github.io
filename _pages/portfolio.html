PhD research
======
To evaluate the extent to which minimally managed plantations of Acacia mangium and their 
subsequent colonization by native vegetation have similar microbial communities, above-ground 
biomass, and soil fertility compared to remnant forests and Imperata cylindrica grasslands within the 
same region and to assess interactions among these aspects of recovery.
