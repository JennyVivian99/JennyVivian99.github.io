Photography
====
Since my childhood, I developed a passion for photography, specifically framing landscapes (both natural and urban). I owned different compact and action cameras, but from 2023 I frame special moments with the reflex Canon EOS 2000D.
[Here](https://www.instagram.com/eleutheriaframes/) I share some of my photos.


Wellbeing: Eating Disorders and Mental Health Awareness
=====
I strongly advocate for a healthy environment, not only in terms of vegetation or animal diversity, but also with respect to 
interactions among people.
Therefore, willing to make my past personal experiences useful for others, I share my story through a written book, thoughts, and talks.
