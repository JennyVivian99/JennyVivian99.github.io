Photography
====
Since my childhood I developed a passion for photography, specifically framing landscapes (both natural and urban). I owned different compact and action cameras, but from 2023 I frame special moments with the reflex Canon EOS 2000D.
[Here](https://www.instagram.com/eleutheriaframes/) I share some of my photos.

The willingness to make my personal experience with eating disorders and mental health issues useful for multiple people, to prevent others from experiencing the same, led me to write and talk about my story.
