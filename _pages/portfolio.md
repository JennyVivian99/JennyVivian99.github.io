PhD research
======
To evaluate the extent to which minimally managed plantations of _Acacia mangium_ and their 
subsequent colonization by native vegetation have similar microbial communities, above-ground 
biomass, and soil fertility compared to remnant forests and Imperata cylindrica grasslands within the 
same region and to assess interactions among these aspects of recovery.

The project is embedded in [Project Tarsier](https://www.usc.edu.au/research/forest-research-institute/project-tarsier)
