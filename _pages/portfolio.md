PhD research
======
To evaluate the extent to which minimally managed plantations of _Acacia mangium_ and their 
subsequent colonization by native vegetation have similar microbial communities, above-ground 
biomass, and soil fertility compared to remnant forests and _Imperata cylindrica_ grasslands within the 
same region and to assess interactions among these aspects of recovery.

The project is embedded in [Project Tarsier](https://www.usc.edu.au/research/forest-research-institute/project-tarsier).
